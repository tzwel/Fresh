# Routing
Fresh comes with a router that automatically fetches the correct route and loads it when it's requested.
You link between routes by appending `/#/` at the beggining of a route, so Fresh knows when to reroute.

An example of linking to another page called `route`:
```html
<a href="/#/route"> A link </a>
```
