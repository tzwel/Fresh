## Declaring components
You declare your components in files ending with the `.fresh` extension, in the `components` directory specified in the config.

On default it's `./fresh/components`

## Example component
An example `nav` component from `components` directory, it's just valid `html` markup so you don't need to learn a new language
```html
<nav>
    <a href="/#/"> Main page </a>
    <a href="/#/route"> Route </a>
</nav>
```
