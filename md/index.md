# ðŸ§Š Fresh
A fresh approach to creating single page apps

----

**Fresh** is a javascript framework built with developers in mind. It forges concepts of many existing frameworks, builds on them and introduces new features to the table.

Fresh is designed as an easy to use and grasp framework, that you can learn in minutes. It's currently focused on `SPA`s but this might change in the future.

âš  **Fresh is a personal side-project. It's heavily work-in-progress and lots of features are still not implemented, or are not working correctly. It's NOT suitable for production yet.** âš
